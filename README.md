# MultiExp Signal Map Generator

Tool to generate synthetic multi-exponential DWI signals for different structures organised in a multi-slice 4D NII format.

Acquisition parameters as number of pixels, number of slices, SNR and b-values can be specified. Expected diffusion parameters (ground truth) d and f may be set (or standard values will be used). Different SNR values and ground truth values may be used per slice.
